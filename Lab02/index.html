    <h1>Learning Web Standards</h1>
        <h2>Labs 1 & 2</h2>
        <p><em>Published on September 12, 2024 by Chris Scroggins</em></p>
        <p>I suppose this is my second officail webpage that I've made for this class if we're counting <br>
        Lab 1. I won't lie I'm kind of having fun learning to make these websites. It's interesting <br>
        how much it takes just to make a single word bold or italic. What's definitly helping me is <br> 
        that HTML isn't too hard to learn or at least grasp the basics to make something. Also <br>
        using Visual Code Studio is way more straight forward unlike Eclipse which tends to <br>
        overwhelmme with all the options and menus.</p>

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><b>How to write in bold</b></li>

                <li><i>How to write in italic</i></li>

                <li>The importance of heading hierarchy</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Leaning about some HTML basics was something I got from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">this cite</a>
            
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp"> and this cite</a></li>
                </ul>
